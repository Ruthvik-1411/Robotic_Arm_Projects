# App(bluetooth) Controlled Robotic Arm 
<b>Working: </b><br><br>
Just like Pot controlled robotic arm another model was built, however the control mechansim is different here. Here, the robotic arm is controlled by a smartphone app that was built using <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor 2.0</a>. From this app(Robotic Arm Controller) each joint of the robotic arm can be controlled via bluetooth HC-05 Module which recieves the data sent from the app and sends it to the arduino to control the servos of each joint. The app's home screen looks like this under some operations <br><br>

<p>The sliders in the image correspond to each servo motor at the gripper, left servo motor, right servo motor and base joint. Similar to the control mechanism used in pot control, if there is a change in the sliders thumbposition then the values in the range of 0-99 are sent to the bluetooth module of arduino via bluetooth from the smartphone.
The code in the Robotic arm controller app is such that these value are sent in a certain order. For instance if the slider of gripper is moved from 25 to 72 the data transmitted will be of the form g26g27g28g29....g71g72. This is done to seperate the inputs of each joint and for the controller to know that the recieved values are for the gripper. Similarly the format for left,right and base servos which are responsible for up/down, forward/backward and rotary movements respectively are strings attached with l,r,b alphabets.</p>
<p>As seen above the values recieved are big strings with that format. But we are only interested in the final position for the servo to move. So in the code the last two elements of the data are read and controller moves to this final position in small steps to keep the whole system physically stable. Now one limitation is that multiple sliders cannot be simultaneously moved. It does not give expected result as you can imagine why it happens. There is an implementation video link at the bottom and in the first part of this video the movement of joints can be clearly seen. The change of the position of servo motors is almost like realtime change, 'almost' beacause of the delay of transmission and delay added in steps taken to reach final position. If the user want the arm to go to its defalut position then Reset sliders button can be pressed. All the positions of the servos are set to defalut.</p>
<p>The app also allows the user to record the steps of the arm's movement and hit Run/Pause to Run those sequence of Saved steps. In the image above the Datalog part shows the steps that are stored in controller and everytime the button send saved step is hit the string Save is sent. When the controller recieves this string then the previous values of each servo is stored in an array(as the previous position is reached only when all these sliders are kept in that position). It keeps saving the steps in the said array for each servo upto a maximum of 47 steps(just a random number limit). In the above image a total of 7 steps are saved and when Run saved steps button is clicked the cntroller starts reading each element from those arrays and sets the servos at the correspodning joints to that angle. In one step all 4 servos reach their final point and the same is done for next steps. This appears as running a sequence of steps. They can also be paused in between. If the user sends a wrong step then Reset saved steps button can be pressed to reset all the data stored in the arrays and data shown in the datalog will also be made default value. The code is commented so it is should be easy to understand after getting a breif idea of the working. </p>
<b>APP:</b><br>
The app is built using the MIT App Inventor and the apk file of the app can be found above. It can installed in any android smartphone and works perfect. After enabling the bluetooth in the device by clicking the Connect button the user can see the list of available or previously connected bluetooth devices. The required device can be connected to by tapping on that device from the list. If the user wants to disconnect the disconnect button can be pressed. The code written in blocks in the mit app inventor workspace can be seen in above files. There are screenshots for each part of the app, bluetooth connectivity, Sliders, Datalog, Send saved steps, Run/Pause saved steps and Reset steps. The apk file can be downloaded and imported in the mit app website and can be modified however the user wants. The app also has a nice logo :).<br>
