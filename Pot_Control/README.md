# Robotic Arm Control using Potentiometers
<b> Working :</b><br>
  The 3-D Robotic arm used in this project has 4 DOF. It has 4 joints which are <br>
  <li> Base - Rotary Joint at the base of the arm
  <li> Left Joint - Joint to move the arm Up/Down
  <li> Right Joint - Joint to move the arm Forward/Backward
  <li> Gripper - used for gripping the objects  <br>
    <p>
    Each Joint is actuated using an sg90 Servo motor which has a 0-180 degrees range of movement. However the entire range cannot be utlized at each joint. Each joint has physical restrictions so only the range in which the arm can move is mapped to each servo. So the range allowed for the right servo to move in my setup is 0-130 degrees. Like this other joints are also calibrated.</p>
<p>Now to operate these servos we use the potentiometer knobs which act as a form of control mechanism. The potentiometer knobs I used have six pins with three pins in each row. Each pin at the top and bottom are the same configurations i.e if the knob is turned the same value of resistance is seen in both sets of pins. Now the connections are made to one set of them. Here the potentiometer is used as a voltage divider circuit. The start and end terminals are assumed to be postive and ground pins. Then by measuring the potential difference between the center pin and ground pin we can see the divided potential difference according to the electrical law. As the voltage only depends on the ratio of resistance on either sides of center pin, a potentiometer of any value of resistance can be used.  </p>
<p>As the analog pins of arduino are 10 bit resolution, by connecting this center pin to the analog pins of arduino we can obtain a value in the range 0-1024 representing the range of 0-5V in the voltage scale. The boundary values might change in decimal places. However, one common problem when measuring the voltage value from these circuits is there will be a stray resistance and it messes with the true value. So to prevent that and to obtain a stable value of voltage when the knob is turned we use a capacitor to filter out the irregularaties. A capacitor of certain range must be used. Else it will be of no use. The capacitor must be connected between the center pin and ground. An overall capacitor across the original 5v and ground can also be connected to ensure stable readings from the circuit.</p>
<p> As said before the servo motors have a restricted movement say 50-130deg or 75-150deg like that. The 4 potentiometers are control knobs for each of these servo motors and the range in which the knobs are turned i.e from 0-1024 value should be matched with the range of servo motors respective ranges. In the code the map funcion can be seen which maps these values from pots to the ranges of individual servos. So as each knob is turned the angle of servo changes with a proportional value allowing the user to have a good control over each joint of the Robotic arm.</p>
